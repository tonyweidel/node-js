# NodeJS-Recreation

The goal of this project is to recreate a mocup of the [Node JS Website](https://nodejs.org).  You will have 4 days in lab to complete all of the HTML, CSS and JS.  Here are some guidelines that will help streamline your process.

### Recommendations
  +  Spend 5 to 10 minutes looking at the website and drawing a diagram of the HTML with all of the necessary tags such as divs and sections.
  +  Create your own HTML, CSS, and JS files inside the folder by right clicking in the left menu and selecting New File.  Here are some suggested names
      -  index.html
      -  style.css
      -  hover.js
  +  Think about what even listeners you will add to which elements.
  +  To grab the same images as on the website, right click on them and copy the image address.
  +  Use the inspect tool > elements if you need hints.
